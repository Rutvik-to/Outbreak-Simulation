Compile: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the C++ source files (Outbreak.cpp, Outbreak.h, Driver.cpp).
Compile the program using a C++ compiler like g++:

g++ Outbreak.cpp Outbreak.h Driver.cpp -o Outbreak

Run: Once compiled, execute the program

Configuration File
The program will prompt you for a configuration file.
These files define the simulation parameters like grid size, initial infected elements, infectious period, etc.
Three example configuration files are provided in the folder.
Feel free to edit these files and the corresponding region files to experiment with different simulation scenarios.
