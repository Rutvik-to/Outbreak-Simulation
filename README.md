Hey There! Welcome to my Outbreak Simulation Github Repo
Feel free to explore.

Reach out to me if you have any questions @ tondwalkarrutvik@gmail.com

Description
This program uses a cellular automata model with a Moore neighborhood configuration to simulate the spread of an infection in a two-dimensional grid.
The state of each element is tracked using the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) Model.

The simulation starts with at least one infected element.
You can customize the infectious period and the threshold (minimum number) of infected elements required for the disease to spread.
The simulation stops when all elements are recovered.

The program is written in both Python and C++.
Refer to the README file in each folder for instructions on running the code.
